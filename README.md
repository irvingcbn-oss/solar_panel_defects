# solar_panel_defects
This project used the pre-trained CNN ResNet50 to classify solar panel images. 
The script above performs image preprocessing and uses transfer learning whit fine-tuning in order to preserve the previously trained features of ResNet50. Finally, the script displays the changes in the model's accuaracy and loss during each epoch.
